## Hi ðŸ‘‹
Iâ€™m Antoine Hilhorst, a research engineer in the field of Materials Science, currently working at UCLouvain.
My interests are:
  - alloy design (for additive manufacturing and low/high temperature applications), 
  - mechanical properties (and their temperature dependence), 
  - and fracture toughness of ductile metallic materials (in thin sheets).
For more information you can visit my <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Antoine-Hilhorst">Research Gate profile</a>

I enjoy developing tools (mostly python or matlab) to help me analyse my data, which will be made available here.
